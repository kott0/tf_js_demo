# tf_js_demo
Tensorflow JavaScript Demo - simple react application that localizes and identifies multiple objects in video stream on client side (react-webcam).

Used model detects objects defined in the COCO dataset, which is a large-scale object detection, segmentation, and captioning dataset. The model is capable of detecting 80 classes of objects (SSD stands for Single Shot MultiBox Detection).

## Tech Stack
- ReactJS, react-webcam
- TensorFlow.js and it's Object Detection (coco-ssd) model
